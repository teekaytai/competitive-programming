I've always enjoyed solving unrealistic problems that no one has, but more recently I've started taking an interest in solving *harder* unrealistic problems that no one has. This repo records my descent into chaos.

Repo contains solutions of varying quality for problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/teekaytai), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/teekaytai), and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/teekaytai).
